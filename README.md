#### What is the Python Challenge
The Python Challenge is a set of riddles that require a little bit of Python programming to be solved. The solutions are entered by changing the address of the page (URL). You get used to the idea pretty fast after solving the first few levels.
What's the purpose of the Python Challenge? 
I've written the challenge in hope that it will provide an entertaining way to explore the Python Programming Language. It is a way to demonstrate the great power of Python's batteries.

#### Where did you get the idea from
I was inspired while I was playing notpron. It just occured to me that the same style of riddles can serve as a way to discover Python.

#### What is the Python programming language
From Python website: "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing."

#### How to get access to the solutions
You can view the solution only after solving the puzzle. In order to prove that you had solved a puzzle, you would have to enter the URL of the next one, but instead of using pc in the URL, write pcc.

For example, if you are now in http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/something.html, then change to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/def/something.html.

If the level requires a password, use the following pattern: http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/somedir/something.html:username:password Entering this special page will give you a ticket for viewing the solution here. Due to security reasons, the ticket is valid only for 24 hours, but you can always renew it, ofcourse.
